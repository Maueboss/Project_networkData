**Dolphin Network Analysis in Cedar Key, Florida**

This project is a visualization and network analysis of bottlenose dolphins’ social behavior in Cedar Key, Florida. Based on the research paper “The importance of delineating networks by activity type in bottlenose dolphins in Cedar Key, Florida” (Gazda et al., 2015), we explore the fission-fusion social structure of these dolphins, with a focus on their behavioral contexts: socializing, traveling, and foraging.
Our goal is to replicate the findings of this research graphically, analyze behavioral patterns, and propose new perspectives.

**Project Objectives**

1. Visualize the behavioral networks of bottlenose dolphins under different activity contexts.
2. Analyze the network characteristics, such as preferential associations and clustering among multiple networks.

**Dataset Description**

The dataset consists of sightings of 147 bottlenose dolphins, observed in 2008 and 2010. Behavioral contexts include:
- Socializing (S)
- Traveling (T)
- Foraging (F)
- Overall (O): all contexts combined.

**Main findings**

The study highlights:
- Dolphins socialize in large groups with preferential associations.
- Travel happens in smaller groups with selective partners.
- Foraging is performed in weakly connected, small groups.
